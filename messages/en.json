        "text1": "The cabins are located at Las Golondrinas n/n, in the El Salto area of Potrerillos, just 65 km from the city of Mendoza. With a privileged location, Cabañas Las Golondrinas offer an unique experience of nature and tranquility, featuring an unobstructed panoramic view of the Andes Mountains.",
        "text2": "Located in the Luján de Cuyo department, 65 km from the city of Mendoza, the Potrerillos Valley is accessible via both National Route 7, which connects Argentina with neighboring Chile, and National Route 82, which runs along the right bank of the Mendoza River, passing through Cacheuta before opening up to a breathtaking view of the Potrerillos Dam. From either route, you can reach Villa Potrerillos, where the entrance features a roundabout with a YPF gas station. Taking the exit marked Valle del Sol, the road passes the local police station on the right and continues for a few kilometers until reaching another roundabout. Taking the right exit from there leads to the town of El Salto. Las Golondrinas Street is accessible from Avenida Los Cóndores, located on the right.",
